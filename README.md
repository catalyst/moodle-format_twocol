# Two Column - Course Format

A course format for Moodle that displays the course overview in two columns.

It has configurable sections that allow for easy display of course summary information.

Each course section (topic) is displayed on its own page.

The side of the page (left or right) that the course image appears on can be set in the format settings.

## Supported Moodle Versions
This plugin currently supports Moodle:

| Moodle version     | Branch               |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Moodle 3.8 to 3.10 | MOODLE_38_STABLE     |
| Moodle 3.11        | MOODLE_311_STABLE    |
| Moodle 4.0+        | MOODLE_400_STABLE    |

## Installation

1. Install the plugin the same as any standard moodle plugin either via the
   Moodle plugin directory, or you can use git to clone it into your source:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:catalyst/moodle-format_twocol.git course/format_twocol
   ```

   Or install via the Moodle plugin directory:

   https://moodle.org/plugins/format_twocol

2. Then run the Moodle upgrade either via the command line of Moodle UI.

## Course images
There are course settings in this course format that apply to the course images.
This course format supports multiple course images.
This is so one image can be used for the course image and another for course header and section header images.

The settings:
* Heading image
* Heading image format

Control the course front page header image settings.

The settings:
* Section image
* Section image format

Control the individual course section image settings

NOTE: By default Moodle only allows 1 course image. For this functionality to work this needs to be changed to 3.
This is done be increasing the `Course image files limit` setting at `Site administration > Appearance > Courses`

### Header background color
A background color can be used instead of course header and section header images.
This can is also displayed "behind" images in case the images are transparent and/or don't fully cover the header area.

### Header image format
You can choose from the course settings how the course and section images are displayed when rendered from the course settings.
There are three options for formatting the display of the header image:
* Contain: Scales the image as large as possible without cropping or stretching the image.
* Contain Left: Sam as contain but the image is left aligned.
* Cover: Scales the image (while preserving its ratio) to the smallest possible size to fill, leaving no empty space. Image may be cropped. 
* Auto: Scales the background image in the corresponding direction such that its intrinsic proportions are maintained.';
